# My Final Automation Project
Welcome to my final automation project repository! This project is dedicated to testing the functionality of a real website called Saucedemo.

## Introduction
[Sauce Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) is an e-commerce website that offers a wide range of products and features for online shoppers. With its user-friendly interface and robust functionalities, Sauce Demo provides customers with a seamless shopping experience. The website includes features such as product browsing, search capabilities, user account management, shopping cart functionality, and secure checkout processes. It may also incorporate additional features such as product reviews, recommendations, and order tracking to enhance the overall shopping experience for users.

The project employs the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to enhance modularity and maintainability within the test suite. This design pattern facilitates better organization of code and improves the scalability of the test suite.
