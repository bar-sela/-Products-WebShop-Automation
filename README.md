# My Final Automation Project
Welcome to my final automation project repository! This project is dedicated to testing the functionality of a real website called Saucedemo.

# Overview
This repository houses a robust automated testing project developed using Java, Selenium,  Maven, TestNG, and Allure Reports. The primary aim of this project is to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the Saucedemo website through automated testing.

The project employs the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to enhance modularity and maintainability within the test suite. This design pattern facilitates better organization of code and improves the scalability of the test suite.
